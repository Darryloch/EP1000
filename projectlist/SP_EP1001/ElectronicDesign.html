                <h1>Electronics Design</h1>
                <p>
                    This si how I design PCBs in my SP EP1001 module.<br>
                    I used Autodesk Fusion 360 and GIMP softwares for this.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Libraries</h3>
                <p>Electronics design libraries that I used can be found here</p>
                <a href="https://skeatz.github.io/Further-DF-and-Prototyping/files/04-electronics-design.html"></a>

                <h3>Fusion 360</h3>
                <p>
                    Create new electronics design in fusion and create new schematic diagram. Add the downloaded libraries from the library manager 
                    or if unable to do so, drag and drop into the libraries folder of Fusion 360 in the computer file explorer. Make sure the libraries 
                    are activated in the library manager. <br>
                    <br>
                    Next, place all the needed components using the "Place components" tool. Search for the components by entering key-words or components 
                    code in the search bar. Arrange all the components and connect them with the "Net" tool.<br>
                    <br>
                    Once the circuit is completed, switch to PCB document to bring you to a space with all the components and their footprints. 
                    Before anything else, click on "DRC" under the "Rules DRC/ERC" tab. Input the line width and clearance as 18 mils and apply.
                    <br>
                    Arrange all the components neatly according to liking and how they can be most easily connected, then connect all the components with the 
                    routing tool. For convenience, I used the auto-router tool to fast connect everything first, I then improved the connections from there.
                    Use the error checker tool to ensure you ahve everything properly connected<br>
                    <br>
                    Once everything is connected, it's time to create the PCB outline. Select the "Board outline" tool, then select the "milling" layer, then 
                    draw out a desired board shape around the circuit. Ensure that the outline is fully closed.<br>
                    <br>
                    Once the PCB design is fully completed, it's time to export it into images. Since Fusion 360 does not have a function for that, you have to
                    input a command line. The command is: <br>
                    export image monochrome &lt;drive:\path\filename.png&gt; &lt;resolution&gt; <br>
                    e.g. export image monochrome c:\ep10001\updi_traces.png 1000<br>
                    <br>
                    Under display layers, select display layers, disable everything except the top and pads layer and export image. this will be the PCB traces. <br>
                    Next, disable everything except for the milling layer and export image again, this will be the PCB outline.
                </p>

                <h3>GIMP</h3>
                <P>
                    Open the images in GIMP, crop the design image out to an appropriate size and fill in the inside spaces to white and leave the outside spaces as black.<br>
                    The white spaces are the parts left untouched during milling and the the outline of the white spaces in the black spaces are cut during PCB milling.
                </P>

                <p>Now you have the images ready to carry out production.</p>
