                <h1>2D CNC Machining</h1>
                <p>This is how I did the large format 2D CNC machining in the SP EP1001 module </p>
                <p>In this assignment, I made an earphone/headphone hanger</p>

                <h3>3D model</h3>
                <iframe src="https://ichat3346.autodesk360.com/shares/public/SH35dfcQT936092f0e4367e218d633079d83?mode=embed" width="640" height="480" 
                allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true"  frameborder="0"></iframe>
                <P>
                    This is the 3D model I designed for the hanger. When making a 3D model, remember to take note of the exact thickness of the wood that you 
                    are using and base the design around that. Make sure the wood is measured beforehand, and best that the 3D model can be edited easily should
                    there be any changes to the thickness used.
                </P>
                <p>
                    Next, create and save the profile sketches of all the parts of the product as a DXF drawing.
                </p>

                <h3>VCarve Pro</h3>
                <p>
                    Create a new file in VCarve Pro and set an appropriate wood area and set wood thickness according to the wood used. 
                    Upload and arrangerrange all the drawings, basing them on the bottome left corner of the drawing sheet at X and Y 0, putting them close 
                    together so as to not waste material later.<br>
                    <br>
                    Use the close vectors tool to check for any open profiles and close them. Add fillets to any sharp inside corners to 
                    accomodate for the cutting tool radius. Add dogbone fillet to inside corners of any intersecting/joining sections so that the
                    joining parts can sit all the way into the joint. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After drawing set-up is done, switch to toolpath programming. Select the tool operation and select the profiles in the drawing to be used
                    in the operation. If there are any pockets, do the pocketing first. <br>
                    In cutting through operations, input cut depth of about 0.5mm more than the thickness of the wood. <br>
                    Select the correct cutter to be be used. <br>
                    Add tabs so that all loose pieces remain held steady amd strongly during cutting. This is also to prevent loose pieces from being picked 
                    up and shot out. Better to add tabs manually by clicking the spots on 
                    the drawing profiles you want the tabs. Make sure to add enough tabs to ensure stabilty even if 1 or 2 tabs end up failing. <br>
                    Toggle on ramping, selecting linear or zig-zag according to what the cutting profile allows. <br>
                    <br>
                    Once all the settings are correct, calculate the toolpath. If there are multiple operations, switch back to 2D view and repeat the 
                    process. <br>
                    After all toolpaths are calculated, go to 3D view and preview all the toolpaths to ensure that the operations and settings are correct. <br>
                    <br>
                    save the toolpath g-code
                </p>
                
                <h3>Machining on te flatbed router</h3>
                <p>
                    On the cutting machine, place and align the stock material onto the cutting bed. Screw down the material around the cuttting area
                    to ensure that the material is completely flat during all the operations.
                </p>

                <p> <b>NOTE: When doing anything onthe machine, keep a hand on the emergency stop in case anything goes wrong.</b> </p>

                <p>
                    Upload the g-code file into the machine software. Ensure that the profiles are correct and that they are correctly positioned from the 0 point. <br>
                    <br>
                    Set the Z axis with the gauge and select and appropriate X and Y 0 point on the stock material. Once done, wear ear and eye protection, 
                    turn on the vacuum, and start the cutting operations. <br>
                    <br>
                    After, the machgine is done cutting, move the cutting head away from the workpieces and cut them out from the tabs with a chisel and mallet. <br>
                </p>

                <h3>Post-processing</h3>
                <p>After all the parts are cut out, all that is left is to sand them smooth and remove burrs and sharp edges.</p>
