                <h1>Electronics Production</h1>
                <p>This is how I produce PCBs for my SP EP1001 module</p>
                <br>

                <h3>Get circuit traces and board outline images</h3>
                <p>First thing to do is to get png images of the circuit board. These are the ones I used.</p>

                <h3>Milling G-code</h3>
                <p>I used Mr. Steven Chew's "mod" program to get milling g-codes needed to produce the boards</p>
                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/EP1001/images/ElectronicProduction/mod.png" alt="mod" height="400">
                <a href="https://skeatz.github.io/mods/">link here</a>
                <p>To navigate to the mod setup used, right click &rarr; click "programs" &rarr; click "open server program" &rarr; under machines &rarr; G-code &rarr; click "mill 2D PCB png"</p>
                <p>
                    Click "select png file" and upload the black and white png image, then select "mill traces" or "mill outline" depending on which
                    part of the PCB the g-code is for. Once set-up is done, everything should be already calculated for you, just click "Calculate" to 
                    obtain the g-code into your downloads. You can also click "view" to get an image of the toolpath.
                </p>

                <h3>PCB Milling</h3>
                <p>Milling of the PCB is done using the Stepcraft 420 2D Router</p>

                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/EP1001/images/ElectronicProduction/tracecutter.jpg" alt="Taces Cutting tool" width="350">
                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/EP1001/images/ElectronicProduction/outlinecutter.jpg" alt="outline Cutting tool" width="350">
                <p>The angled cutter is used for milling the PCB traces, the thin cutter is for milling the outline of the PCB</p>

                <p>
                    Take a plain copper PCB board and stick it to the Stepcraft machining bed with some double-sided tape, reinforce with masking tape if
                    neccessary. The board should not be able to move around easily.<br>
                    <br>
                    In the Stepcraft software, load the g-code file for the traces first. Set the Z 0 point of the machine on top of the copper board, then set
                    the X and Y 0 points accordingly to mill over an empty spot on the copper board. Move the cutter around and check with the toolpath location 
                    in the software to make sure you are milling in the correct spot.<br>
                    <br>
                    Once set-up is done, click cycle start to begin milling
                </p>
                <p>
                    After milling the Traces, load the g-code for the PCB outline and repeat the process, but without overiding the X and Y 0 coordinates.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Post-processing</h3>
                <p>
                    After milling, you should have a rough-looking PCB board. <br>
                    <br>
                    Sand down the copper surface of the PCB until it's flat and smooth out any other rough edges or surfaces.<br>
                    <br>
                    Next, with a pen-knife, carefully shave out any pieces of excess copper inbetween the PCB traces to ensure there are no short circuits
                    and to make everything more cleanly separated.
                </p>

                <h3>Soldering</h3>
                <p>
                    All that is left to do now is to solder all the surface-mount parts onto the PCB, you can also add some sodler to parts you don't want
                    to oxidise or to thicken the area a bit.
