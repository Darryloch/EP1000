                <h1>Creating my own website</h1>
                <p>This page walks through how I set up my own website to document my projects</p>
                <p>
                    To create my own website, I generally followed Jake Wright's youtube guides on HTML and CSS and only edited some parts to suit my own preferances. 
                    Thus, my website will look very similar to his example.<br>
                    <br>

                <h3>Files & folders</h3>
                <p>
                    I have a main folder that contains everything related to this project. Inside the main folder, I have the files for my three main pages, the 
                    index, about and projects page, and the CSS files that is used to style the website. There are also sub-folders that contains all other files, 
                    such as a images folder and a folder to contain all my dedicated project documentaion pages. For every different content in my website, there 
                    will be a new file and page created, and pages with similar content are categorised to keep things organised and easy to understand<br>
                    <br>
                    Below will explain the layout of my website pages and some of the HTML functions used to create it.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Writing in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h2>
                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/EP1000/images/Index_page.png" alt="html" height="250">
                
                <h3>Basic layout</h3>
                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/EP1000/images/Page_format_template.png" alt="page format template" height="200">
                <p>
                    Everything in my website and the layout choices are kept simple, straighforward and organised neatly to provide ease of use and navigation.<br>
                    I have a main website header and a navigation bar present at the top across all pages so that the layout will be consistent. <br>
                    Only the main contents of the page below that will change, and all pages have a header at the start to introduce the content of the page.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Home/Index page</h3>
                <p>
                    The home page is the only page with a different layout to keep it from being too boring. Since the home page also does not have much content on my 
                    website, I decided that it would look better with everything centralised. Since I wanted to centralise everything in the home page, I wrote 
                    as if it were and would later shift and organise with CSS.<br>

                    I used a table to list out items in my navigation bar horizontally and later used CSS to space them out.<br>
                    <br>
                    A simple page header, "HOME", was used and bars were added to both sides to fill up the page. Then a simple and straightforward introduction 
                    to the use of the website below the header is put right below.<br>
                    <br>
                    I also decided to display my EP1000 certifications on the home page, such as the passing of the lab safety and 3D printing online test, so that it 
                    can be easily seen for the module assessment. This may be later changed after completion of the module.
                </p>
            
                <h3>About page</h3>
                <p>
                    In my about page, I put a profile picture and used a table function to wrap text containing some basic personal details to the side of it, similar
                    to an IC card or ID part of a passport. Below that I put a thin line across the page to seperate the rest of the about page that will provide 
                    further introduction to myself.<br>
                    <br>
                    Below the line, I gave a short write-up about myself and used an unordered list below that to list some of my interests.
                </p>
            
                <h3>Projects page</h3>
                <p>
                    I decided that my main projects page will just list out most projects that I have done or will be doing, as well as provide links to the dedicated
                    documentation page. So I put a page header and gave a very short introduction to the page with a paragraph function at the top.
                    I then used headers to sort and categorise based on methods used or type of project, and used an unordered list function to list out the projects
                    I have done. Each list item is a link to the project documentaion page, done by using the &lt;a&gt; function in the list item.
                </p>

                <h2>Styling with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/projects/images/CSS_example.png" alt="CSS" height="250">
                <p>
                    After creating a working webpage in HTML. A CSS text file was then used to make my web pages look better and not just plain text against
                    a white background. CSS allowed me to set a border for different text bodies, shift text bodies to different parts of the pages, change background colours. 
                    I could also further edit the look of the page content, such as text alignment, font type, font colour and font size.<br>
                    <br>
                    Since all pages in my website follows the same layout except for the home page, I created two CSS text files: one for the home page, and 
                    a second one for everything else. Reusing one file for multiple pages allows me to keep my website layout consistent.
                </p>

                <h3>Editing the HTML files</h3>
                <p>
                    Before writing the CSS files, the first step I had to do was to put everything in my HTML files into divisions using the &lt;div&gt; function. 
                    This allows each part to be edited, styled or shifted independently without unintentionally affecting other parts.<br>
                    <br>
                    Following Jake Wright's CSS guide, I have:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>&lt;div id="container"&gt; which contains all parts inside the &lt;body&gt; commands of the HTML file and all other divisions.</li>
                        <li>&lt;div id="header"&gt;    which contains the website header</li>
                        <li>&lt;div id="content"&gt;   which contains the nav and main divisions</li>
                        <li>&lt;div id="nav"&gt;       which contains the navigation bar and the functions used for it</li>
                        <li>&lt;div id="main"&gt;      which contains the main contents of the page</li>
                        <li>&lt;div id="footer"&gt;    which contains the website footer, which contains a copyright claim following Jake Wright's example</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h3>Style sheet for most of the pages</h3>
                <p>
                    I did the CSS file for the rest of the pages first, since that was directly following Jake Wright's guide. The result is almost identical
                    to Jake Wright's example, with only the colours and some padding or spacing changed to my preferences.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>#background</h4>
                    The background colour of the website is set to grey of hex code #666666
                    <br>
                    <h4>#container</h4>
                    I started with the container, which holds all of my website content.<br>
                    The width is set to 1024 pixels.<br>
                    The colour is set to a light grey with hex code #eeeeee.<br>
                    Lastly, margin-left and margin-right is added and set to auto to put it in the middle of the browser.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>#header</h4>
                    I set the background colour to a mint green of hex code #A4E4CE.<br>
                    I set the text colour to white and text is aligned to the center.<br>
                    Padding is set to 30px.(30 pixels on all sides.)<br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>#content</h4>
                    Padding set to 10px, 20px, 20px, 20px.<br>
                    (10 pixels from the top, 20 pixels from the right, 20 pixels from the bottom and 20 pixels fom the left.)<br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>#nav</h4>
                    For the navigation bar, a float left command was set so it would be shifted to the left of the container.<br>
                    The width is set to 140 pixels.<br>
                    Padding is set to 0px, 0px, 0px, 10px.(10 pixels from the left.)<br>
                    Background colour is set to slightly darker than pure white with hex code #fefefe.<br>
                    <br>
                    Then, a "#Nav ul" was added below #nav, to edit the unordered list used in the navigation bar.<br>
                    I set list style type to none to remove the dots from the unordered list.<br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>#main</h4>
                    The main content of the page is to be shifted to the right of the container, so a float right command was set.<br>
                    The width is set to 800 pixels.<br>
                    Background colour is set to #fefefe as well.<br>
                    Padding is set to 0px, 5px, 10px, 20px.(5 pixels from the right, 10 pixels from the bottom, 20 pixels from the left)<br>
                    <br>
                    <h4>#footer</h4>
                    For the footer, a "clear: both" command was set so the footer appears below the "nav" and "main" divisions.<br>
                    Padding is set to 10px.(10 pixels from all sides)<br>
                    Background colour is set to a grey with hex code #999999.<br>
                    Text colour is set to white and the text is aligned to the right.<br>
                </p>

                <h3>Home/Index page</h3>
                <p>
                    The CSS file for the home page is largely copied from the original CSS file style sheet, and edited accordingly to get the final result.<br>
                    <br>
                    I removed the #nav, #nav ul and #main parts as both the navigation and main content will be controlled under #content.<br>

                    <h4>#content</h4>
                    Under #content, I aligned the text to the center.<br>
                    I then made the font size larger using "font-size: larger;"<br>
                    Padding stays the same.<br>
                    <br>

                    I then added a "#nav table", to edit the navigation bar.
                    <h4>#nav table</h4>

                </p>
