        To create my own website, I generally followed Jake Wright's youtube guides on HTML and CSS and only edited some parts to suit my own preferances. 
        Thus, my website will look very similar to his example.<br>

    <h2>Writing in HTML</h2>
    <p>
        Among my files, I have my three main pages, the index, about and projects page, in the main folder and everything else sorted into sub-folders, such 
        as an images folder and another folder that contains all the dedicated documentation pages for each project I have done. For every different content
        in my website, there will be a new file and page created, and pages with similar content are categorised to keep things organised and easy to understand<br>
        <br>
        Below will explain the layout of my website pages and some of the HTML functions used to create it.
    </p>

    <h3>Home/Index page</h3>
    <p>
        As seen from the home page, I decided to keep it simple and minimal since there will not be much content there. Any significant content will be placed 
        and organised in other parts of the website.<br>
        <br>
        At the end, I wanted to centralise everything in the homee page so I wrote as if it were and would later shift and organise with CSS.<br>
        I used a table to list out items in my navigation bar horizontally and later used CSS to space them out.<br>
        I decided on a simple page header, "HOME", and added bars to both sides to fill up the page, and gave a simple and straightforward introduction to 
        the use of the website below the header.<br>
        I also decided to display my EP1000 certifications on the home page, such as the passing of the lab safety and 3D printing online test, so that it 
        can be easily seen for the module assessment. This may be later changed after completion of the module.

    <h3>About page</h3>
    <p>
        In my about page, I put a profile picture and used a table function to wrap text containing some basic personal details to the side of it, similar
        to an IC card or personal details part of a passport. I chose to do this as it was simple, straighforward and easy to understand.<br>
        <br>
        Below that I put a thin line across the page to seperate the rest of the about page that will provide further introduction to myself, such as
        the breif write-up and some interests.
    </p>

    <h3>Projects page</h3>
    <p>
        I decided that my main projects page will just list out most projects that I have done or will be doing, as well as provide links to the dedicated
        documentation page. So I put a page header and a very short introduction to the page at the top, and use a list to provide links to the documentation
        page. The page is sorted with headers and seperate list functions according to methods used or type of projects.
