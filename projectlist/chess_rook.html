                <h1>Rook Chesspiece</h1>
                <p>
                    This page will walk through how I designed a 3D model of a rook chesspiece.<br>
                    This is done using Autodesk Fusion 360.
                </p>
                <h3>Template</h3>
                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/EP1000/images/rook/rook_template.png" alt="Rook template" height="250">
                <p>
                    The first step in modelling a chesspiece is to find a 2D design, icon or drawing to trace over during the sketching later.
                    This can easily be done by searching google images for a suitable image. In my case I used the image shown above.<br>
                    Save the image to insert it into Fusion360 later.
                </p>

                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/EP1000/images/create_1st_sketch.png" alt="Create new sketch" height="250">
                <p>From the browser, open up the origin tab, select any plane, right-click and create new sketch.</p>

                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/EP1000/images/rook/rook_template_scale.png" alt="Rook template with scale" height="250">
                <p>
                    Insert the saved template with insert canvas, and scale it so that the chess piece is 50mm tall and 15mm radius / 30mm diameter.<br>
                    Align the template such that the sketch plane origin is at the bottom center of the chesspiece.
                </p>

                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/EP1000/images/rook/rook_centerline.png" alt="create centerline" width="300">
                <p>
                    Draw a vertical line from the origin across the whole chesspiece, making sure to extend past the chesspiece slightly.<br>
                    Right-click the line and convert it into a centerline.
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/EP1000/images/rook/rook_base.png" alt="rook base" height="250">
                <p>
                    From the origin, draw a rectangle of 15mm length and 5mm height.<br>
                    Then, draw a left slanted line from the top right coerner of the rectangle with angle 50&#176; from the recrangle.<br>
                    Set the height of the slanted line to be 2.5mm from the top of the rectangle to the top end of the line.
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/EP1000/images/rook/rook_base_spline.png" alt="rook base spline curve" height="250">
                <p>
                    Create a control point spline, starting the curve at the end of the slanted line created earlier, enter a control point to the right
                    of the template line, and enter a second control point to the left of the template curve, and enter a final point and the end of the 
                    template curve. Once done, you should get a recurve shape with 2 control points.<br>
                    <br>
                    With the dimensioning tool, set the first control point to be 5.5mm above and 1.5mm to the right of the start of the spline.<br>
                    Set the second control point to be 3.5mm below and 0.25mm to the right of the end point of the spline.<br>
                    Set the horizontal length between the 2 control points to be 4.65mm.<br>
                    <br>
                    From the end of the spline, draw a horzontal line to the centerline, and with the dimensioning tool, set the height from the top of the 
                    base rectangle to the horizontal line to be 10.5mm.
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/EP1000/images/rook/rook_arc_curve.png" alt="rook arc curve" height="250">
                <p>
                    Create a rectangle, starting from the intersection of the horizontal line made previously and the centerline, and drag right.<br> 
                    Use the coincident constrain tool to fix the bottom right corner of the rectangle to the end of the spline made previously.<br>
                    With the dimensioning tool, set the rectangle height to 2mm.<br>
                    <br>
                    Create a 3 point arc, starting the arc at the end of the spline, enter the second point along the top of the rectangle that was just made, 
                    and adjust the arc such that it is tangent to the rectangle.<br>
                    With the dimensioning tool, set the distance between the end point of the arc and the top right corner of the rectangle to be 1.6mm.
                </p>
                <br>
                <img src="https://darryloch.github.io/EP1000/images/rook/rook_long_curve.png" alt="rook long curve" width="300">
                <p>
                    To create the long curve, create a control point spline, starting from the end of the arc created previously, enter a control point on the 
                    left of the template curve, and enter the final point at the end of the template curve. Once done, you should have a curve with 1 control 
                    point.<br>
                    <br>
                    With the dimensioning tool, set the height of the apline curve to be 17.25mm, and set the control point to be 7.5mm from the bottom of the 
                    curve, 2mm to the left of the start point, and 0.35mm to the left of the end point.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Create a rectangle starting from the centerline above the long spline.<br>
                    With the dimensioning tool, set the rectangle to be 3.2mm above the long spline.<br>
                    Set the rectangle to be 10.5mm long and 2mm thick.<br>
                    <br>
                    Next, create a circle, with center point the midpoint of the right side of the rectangle just created and tangent to the top and bottom of 
                    the rectangle.<br>
                    <br>
                    Create a 3-point arc starting from the end of the long spline curve to the bottom right corner of the rectangle above, setting the arc to 
                    be tangent to the circle.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the final part of the sketch, create a rectangle, starting from the top right corner of the previous rectangle and attaching it to the 
                    centerline. Use the dimensioning tool to set the top to be 50mm from the bottom of the sketch.
