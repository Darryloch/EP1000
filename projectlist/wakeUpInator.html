                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>
                    This idea came about because I always have trouble staying awake when doing work or studying, so I have been thinking about having 
                    something that could keep me awake. Thus, I thought, "Alarms are made to alert or wake people up, so what if I could have an alarm
                    that can trigger when I fall asleep?" 
                    So for that, I need a way to detect if I fall asleep or stay still for too long, and something to make noise to wake me back up. <br>
                    <br>
                    For the first task, a motion sensor combined with a timer can be used. I used a PIR motion sensor and set up a timer within the 
                    arduino code.<br>
                    <br>
                    For the second task of making noise, I needed a way that was as simple as possible since I have little experience before. 
                    Since a DC motor was the most straighforward component I could think to use, I thought of ideas that could make use of that.
                    With that in mind, I remembered that other people have 3D printed mini air raid sirens that can be quite loud, so I thought that 
                    I could use that idea but attach it to a DC motor to power it. The principles behind the siren was simple as well.

                <h2>Design sketch</h2>
                <p>
                    With the idea in place, I needed to design the device. <br>
                    For the siren, I took inspiration from already existing designs of 3D printed
                    air raid sirens that can be found on thingiverse. I ultimately designed the final product myself. <br>
                    The box housing was designed around the measurements of the circuit components, such that I could snugly fit everything inside. <br>
                    After a few iterations, I settled on the final design below.
