                <h2>Ideation</h2>
                <p>
                    This idea came about because I always have trouble staying awake when doing work or studying, so I have been thinking about having 
                    something that could keep me awake. Thus, I thought, "Alarms are made to alert or wake people up, so what if I could have an alarm
                    that can trigger when I fall asleep?" 
                    So for that, I need a way to detect if I fall asleep or stay still for too long, and something to make noise to wake me back up. <br>
                    <br>
                    For the first task, a motion sensor combined with a timer can be used. I used a PIR motion sensor and set up a timer within the 
                    arduino code.<br>
                    <br>
                    For the second task of making noise, I needed a way that was as simple as possible since I have little experience before. 
                    Since a DC motor was the most straighforward component I could think to use, I thought of ideas that could make use of that.
                    With that in mind, I remembered that other people have 3D printed mini air raid sirens that can be quite loud, so I thought that 
                    I could use that idea but attach it to a DC motor to power it. The principles behind the siren was simple as well.

                <h2>Design sketch</h2>
                <p>
                    With the idea in place, I needed to design the device. <br>
                    For the siren, I took inspiration from already existing designs of 3D printed
                    air raid sirens that can be found on thingiverse. I ultimately designed the final product myself. <br>
                    The box housing was designed around the measurements of the circuit components, such that I could snugly fit everything inside. <br>
                    After a few iterations, I settled on the final design below.

                <h3>Siren fan shroud</h3>
                <p>
                    Select the xy plane and create sketch. Draw 2 concentric circles, one of diameter 60mm, another of diameter 55mm. <br>
                    Finish sketch and extrude the space inbetween the 2 circles by 30mm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Create an offset workplane with reference to either the xz or yz plane, and offset by 30mm. Create sketch on the new workplane. <br>
                    Draw a vertical line from the origin to above the shroud and set as centerline. <br>
                    <br>
                    Then, draw a rectangle of 15mm width, 9mm height and set the rectangle to be 6mm above the bottom of the shroud.
                    Set the two ends of the rectangle to be symetrical about the centerline and finish sketch. <br>
                    <br>
                    Select the rectangle and extrude cut through all. <br>
                    <br>
                    Create a circular pattern, selecting the extrude cut feature, with angular spacing set to full and quantity set to 3.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Create a new sketch on the offset workplane. Draw a vertical line as centerline again. <br>
                    <br>
                    Draw a rectangle of 12mm width, 9mm height and set the rectangle to be 18mm above the bottom of the shroud. <br>
                    <br>
                    Set the rectangle to be symetrical about the centerline and finish the sketch. <br>
                    <br>
                    Select the ractangle and extrude cut through all. <br>
                    <br>
                    Create another circular pattern, selecting the second extrude cut feature, setting angular spacing to full and quantity to 8.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the bottom face of the shroud, create a new sketch. <br>
                    <br>
                    Draw a diameter 10mm circle that is tangent to the outer wall of the shroud. <br>
                    <br>
                    Draw a vertical line from the origin and constrain the end of the line to the center of the circle. <br>
                    <br>
                    Draw a diameter 4mm circle concentric to the 10mm circle. <br>
                    <br>
                    Draw two parallel lines tangent to the dia 10mm circle from the left and right points of the circle and connect it to the outer diameter
                    of the shroud. Finish the sketch once done<br>
                    <br>
                    Extrude join the feature by -2.5mm or to 2.5mm above the bottom of the shroud, selecting everything except the 4mm circle. <br>
                    <br>
                    Create a circular pattern, select the feature, set angular spacing to full and quantity to 3.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Select the top face of the shroud and create sketch. <br>
                    <br>
                    Outline the inner and outer diameter of the shroud by draw two concentric circles with the same diameters of 60mm and 55mm. <br>
                    <br>
                    Draw another concentric circle of diameter 30mm. <br>
                    <br>
                    Create an offset of the circle of -2.5mm offset. <br>
                    <br>
                    draw a vertical line from the center of the circles to the dia 55mm circle, set as centerline. <br>
                    <br>
                    Draw 2 parallel vertical lines connecting from the dia 30mm circle to the dia 55mm cirlce, constrain the two lines to be symetrical 
                    about the centerline. <br>
                    <br>
                    Create a circular pattern, select the two parallel lines, set angular spacing to full and quantity to 6. <br>
                    <br>
                    Extrude join the feature, selecting the spaces between the pairs of lines and circles., extrude by 1mm.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Siren fan</h3>
                <p>
                    Create a offset workplane, select the xy plane as reference, off set by 1.5mm. <br>
                    <br>
                    Create a sketch on the offset plane. <br>
                    draw a circle of diameter 53mm, center on the the origin. Finish the sketch. <br>
                    <br>
                    Extrude the circle by 3mm. <br>
                    <br>
                    Select the top face of the 53mm circle and create sketch. <br>
                    <br>
                    Draw a circle of 53mm diameter, center on the origin. <br>
                    Create an offset of the circle, with -2mm offset.<br>
                    <br>
                    Draw a vertical line going through circle center and set as centerline. <br>
                    <br>
                    Create a 3-point arc. <br>
                    Connect the first point to the origin or center of the circles. <br>
                    connect the second point to the top-right of the 53mm circle. <br>
                    Place the last point such that the arc is tangent to the centerline. <br>
